# Shell Project - Codecrafters

## Overview
This is a simple shell built in C as part of the Codecrafters course. It emulates basic shell functionality like command execution, input/output redirection, and built-in commands.

## Features
- Execute commands using `pwd` and `ls`.
- Handle environment variables.
- Input/output redirection (`>`, `<`).
- Built-in commands like `exit` and `cd`.

## Usage
1. Compile the code:
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o shell  
    ```

2. Run the shell:
    ./shell

3. You can now run commands like:
    ```bash
    ls
    cd /Users/paulina/Documents/GitHub/Shell/Shell
    echo "Hello World" > file.txt
    ```

## Installation
To install and run the shell:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pmschz/Shell.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory and compile the code:
    ```bash

    g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o shell   
    ```
